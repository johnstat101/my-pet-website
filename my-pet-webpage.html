    <h1>My Favourite Pet</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>My favorite pet is a dog. They have been bred by humans
      for a long time, and were the first animals ever to be
      domesticated. There are different studies that suggest
      that this happened between 15.000 and 100.000 years b
      efore our time. I love my dog because of the following
      reasons</p>
    <ol>
      <li>It is playful</li>
      <li>It is friendly</li>
      <li>And loyal</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Dogs, as opposed to many pets, can also help humans do various tasks as well</p>
    <p>These tasks may include</p>
    <ul>
      <li>providing security</li>
      <li>detecting harmful objects</li>
      <li>transport on ice areas</li>
      <li>And so much more</li>
    </ul>
